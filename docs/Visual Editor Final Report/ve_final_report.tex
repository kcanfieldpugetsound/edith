\subsection{Challenges}
\subsubsection{Technical Challenges}

The biggest technical challenge that I faced while on the Visual Editor team was my personal inexperience with the HTML5 Canvas or any of the graphical JavaScript libraries. After learning that the visual editor was going to be based in an HTML5 Canvas, I started to go through the process of figuring out how it worked and how to use it. I was told that the Canvas was very similar to doing graphics in Java, but since I had little to no experience with Java graphics, that advice did not help me as much. Two things mainly helped me overcome this challenge. The first was my prior experience using JavaScript and HTML. Even though the Canvas was unfamiliar, the language used to control it was very familiar and I was able to use my prior knowlege to accelerate the learning process. The second learning tool was simply trial-and-error. No one on the visual editor team had ever used the HTML5 Canvas or KineticJS before so what really helped us was several test documents trying to figure out how object were created and how we could interact with them. 

\subsubsection{Organizational Challenges}

Unlike other groups working on the Edith project, our group had six members, opposed to five. Since none of us had any familiarity with the technologies we were working with, our organizational challenges revolved around slow progress. Another challenge that surrounded the visual editor is that it was very difficult to seperate work out until we had a solid foundation of what we were doing with Canvas and KineticJS and how we were going to execute such actions. Until we got to a point where we had a plan of action in which we knew how things were going to be done, we were unable to work seperately and the only time progress was made was when all of us could meet up and surround one computer while we tried things out. Fortunately, we soon figured out what we were trying to do and were clearly able to divide tasks among group members.

\subsection{Applied Software Engineering}

Many aspects of the visual editor were designed and implemented according to software engineering techniques, however, I thought that the biggest lesson from software engineering we used was on creating the user interface. We estimated that the visual editor component of Edith is where the typical end-user would spend the majority of their time. Because of this, we wanted to spend some time on designing the user interface and become aware of exactly what actions users would be able to perform and make sure that certain elements of the editor are presented in a consistent manner.

\subsection{Different Approach}

One of the largest over-arching challenges that the visual editor team faced was that we were unsure of our requirements for the project and I felt like each of us had 'an idea' of what we were doing, but no one's ideas actually matched up with anyone else's. This posed a big problem at the beginning of this project and until we were sure of what we were doing, our progress stalled and at some points, came to a halt. If I were to do this project again, I would make sure that I was completely aware of the project/section requirements. If I were given more time to continue to work on this project, I would want to improve some of the graphical elements and transitions on the visual editor. The boxes and 'method containers' used currently are functional, but I feel like with more time, I could make those boxes more visually appealing. Another feature I would implement is ease-of-use for the end-user. That is, making sure it is clear how to operate the visual editor and making sure the user is not confused when they are trying to operate the application.
