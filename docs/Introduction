Introduction - Edith and the Visual Editor Module

	Edith is educational software designed to introduce new computer science students to programming.  New students of any age can learn basic object-oriented programming concepts
	prior to learning a particular programming language in detail (syntax, data types and structures, etc.).  Edith provides a graphical user interface through which
	users can create a "script" that animates a 2-D character, or sprite, provided by the program.  The user creates the script by piecing together provided blocks of 
	program structure in a functional way.  Users may create games and share their creations with others. 
	Similar programs (e.g., Alice) have been shown to increase the interest level and retention of students taking their first programming classes.	
	Edith will be written primarily in JavaScript and will be available over the internet.  After initial development, the software will be open-source to allow 
	further development and additional educational opportunities.  
	
	The Visual Editor (VE) module will provide a visual programming language editor (in essence, an integrated development environment(IDE)).  The VE will allow users
	to arrange programming elements to create an animation sequence; programming elements will include methods, variables, control statements, etc. 
	The VE will, while enforcing syntax rules, convert the program into JavaScript, which will be used by other modules.

	The VE will directly interact with two other Edith modules, Object Creator and Story Creator.  It will provide the Object Creator an interface for defining
	objects, and the Story Creator an interface for defining animations.  The VE will be able to run its own disply view and integrate into the views of 
	other Edith modules.
	
	The user will be able to export his program in JavaScript/JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. JSON is an efficient data interchange text format that is language independent.
