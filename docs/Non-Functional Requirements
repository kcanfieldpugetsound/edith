Non-Functional Requirements

Usability.  
Training should not be required for users to effectively use the module.  
Module documentation and basic age-specific computer knowledge should provide sufficient guidance.
The module should allow the user to recover from errors with informative and understandable error messages.

Documentation.
The module will provide documentation that allows users to easily begin using the system.

Modifiability.
The module will have the flexibility to allow feature expansion over time.

Privacy.
The user's work will remain private/secure unless the user chooses to share it.

Learning Experience.
In order to support the learning of young computing students, the module will provide
a sufficiently "pleasant" interface.

Platform.
Users will be able to run the module from Windows or Mac [TEAM - DO YOU EXPECT THIS TO BE TRUE?]

Open Source.
After initial development, the source code will be open and redistributed with improvements by anyone.
