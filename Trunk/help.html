	<h2>What is Edith?</h2>
		Edith is an online program that allows you to code your own two dimensional story. You can create an object for your story, code some animations for it, and watch it go!
	<br> <br>
	<h2>Let's try it!</h2>
		We can start off by creating an object of our own! Just click the button on the top of the page that says "Make Object"
		
		<br><br><center><img src="tutorialPix/makeObject.jpg"></center><br>

		Great! A window should come up that looks a lot like below. Now make an object! I already made one for us to use, but if you need help on how to make an object, click the "Need Help?" button on that page.

		<br><br><center><img src="tutorialPix/object.png" width=500 height=450 align="middle"></center><br>

		Now back on the main page, if you click the load button on the top of the page, and type in the name of the object you just created, it will load your object into the object viewer on the bottom of the screen! Then if you double click the object, and enter a position, it will appear on the screen!

		Now you're ready to code! On the right side of the screen is your coding area. The blue boxes are categories, and the orange boxes are coding boxes. You can drag the orange boxes over the red line to put them in your code. Below I have coded a simple jump. I dragged over the "method" box and called my method "jump", but didn't enter any parameters. Then went to the "predefined" category and dragged over the "jump" box while having my stick figure selected. (To select a stick figure, just click them, they will glow to show that they are active) I also was prompted to enter the duration and height of the jump. Finally, I went back to the "method" category and dragged over the "end" box to end my method. And just like that, I have a simple method to make my stick figure jump!

		Just press play and get ready to see your creation in action!
